# PAMM
Mapping mutation is a probabilistic approach to infer possible evolutionary histories of the observed data (Nielsen 2002). It offers a powerful approach studying the pattern of substitution on a phylogenetic tree. The specific version implemented here is designed to analyze large amount of sequence data in a flexible fashion. The major highlights of the programs are: 1) The ability to handle large amount of sequence data (e.g. Influenza sequences). 2) A flexible approach to investigate the mutational pattern (especially adaptive evolution) over different combinations of branches and sites.
